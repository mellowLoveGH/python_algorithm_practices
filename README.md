python, algorithm study &amp; review, practices

Those 2 books are downloaded online, which are quite useful to study & review algorithm knowledges.
But it seems they are quite difficult.

When reading the book(s), some practices are inevitable, and as you know, practice makes perfect.

I may update those codes in future when needed.
